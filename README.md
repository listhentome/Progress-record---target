# Progress record-target

This is a novel to-do type application.
The simple and clean interface makes it easy to get started.
It is different from other applications in that it specifies your task time in minutes, allowing you to visually see how much your task has completed.
Different kinds of task types are marked with different colors.
Count the average completion progress of all tasks.
Count the number of tasks for each category so that you can plan the completion time of each task reasonably.
Very simple but very practical application.
